# Flatflap-Actuator


This project showcases my work with FlatFlap actuators—small modules that provide tactile feedback through motion. I soldered, assembled, and integrated the actuators, creating a working setup that demonstrates their motion and haptic capabilities.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate hands-on soldering skills, microcontroller integration, and understanding of actuator control for haptic feedback systems.
